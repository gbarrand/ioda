 iOS : the usage of isinf() in ofstd/libsrc/ofstd.cc induces a
       non validation of the binary when submitting to the AppleStore.
       (non-public API usage). As the finite() function in my_isinf()
       is not known on iOS, we just "return false" in the case of iOS.
       For what we are doing, it seems ok.              
  
 MacOSX : clang : in some template classes inheriting a template, have :
      if (DiColorPixelTemplate<T>::Init(pixel)) //G.Barrand

 cfunix.h : avoid HAVE_STDDEF_H, HAVE_STDLIB_H that clases with
            the ones in jpeg.
