 We have implemented the Apple document interchange for file types
 known by ioda. Now applications as Dropbox, GoodReader, Mail
 can "Open in..." a file toward ioda.

 We have added a FTP button in the main menu to be able to get data
 files with FTP. With this button and the upper interchange feature
 you can get data files without the need to connect your device
 to a desktop.

 A "params" button had been added to specify some visualization parameters.
 For example you can now render a FOG file in solid with or without
 lightening. The "lighten cube" example had been added to play with this
 feature.

 The bottom left area in the camera panel is now a button that permits
 to toggle the arrows to a "90 degrees" mode. When set, the left/right
 (up/down) arrows rotates the camera by 90 degrees around the y (x) axis.

 When browsing a CERN/ROOT file, directories are no more prefixed with "d:"
 but are shown with a different color (by default in light grey whilst files
 are still rendered in white).

 In the "entries" example, the labels had been changed to : text, uint,
 int, real. It helpes understand the comportement of the entry keyboard
 for each kind of item.
