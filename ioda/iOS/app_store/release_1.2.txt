 ntuple projection : for ntuple (defined as a table of columns with numbers),
 ioda can now do interactive projections of one or two columns in a 1D or 2D
 histogram. This works for a "flat TTree" in a ROOT file, a BINARY_TABLE in
 a FITS file, a flat ntuple in an AIDA file and table data in a CSV file.

 new file types : CSV, hippodraw TNT (CSV+a header with a first line for
 a global title and a second line with labels of columns).

 examples : have a demo.root file to play with ntuple.

 plot style : once having a plot, this sub menu permits to change the overall
 style according to a set of predefined ones.

 FTP : we have implemented "FTP passive".
