1.14.0 :
 - read HDF5 files with g4tools data semantic. A g4b4.hdf5 file comes in the res directory.
 - examples/paw_py_root/all.kumac : show all PAW_py_root examples (see also gopaw pages).
 - include GOPAW core.
 - comres : handle python_2_7_lib_py.zip. Unfolded at startup.
 - res : tree.lua, hrand.lua.
 - iOS, Cocoa, mgr/build : have -DINLIB_USE_CSZ for inlib_swig_[lua,py].cpp.
 - Android : Android.mk -DINLIB_USE_CSZ for inlib_swig_[lua,py].cpp.

1.13 :
 - read .lua, .py files.
 - read heprep.zip files containing multiple heprep files.
 - cfitsio : fitsio2.h : __arm64__.
 - <) : change logic (have a "radius" one) so that it is ok on M.Monville that has models thin in z but large in x,y.
 - examples/hrand.py,riv.py,rroot.py,tree.py.
 - left camera panel : W/B, clear.
 - release notes iOS : Have FITS reading for arm64. Read HepRep zip files. Improve the logic of "View All" : on a model
   thin in z, the camera were too close, now it is better. Have a "W/B" button in the left camera panel to change
   background color (White or Black). Have also a clear scene button.

1.12 :
 - read heprep files.
 - iOS, Android : have CoinGL.
 - release notes iOS : Read VRML and Inventor files. Read HepRep SLAC file format version 1 and 2. For HepRep we can display
   geometries found in these files both in wire-frame and solid. (If wanting solid, you have to set Params/solid first).
   See file/Resources *.iv, *.hiv, *.wrl, *.heprep for examples. When picking an object in the scene, there is now an
   "axes" menu item in the popup menu. It creates axes close to the picked object that permit to measure things around
   the object. The scale of the axes are given by the bounding box of the picked object. The axes are themselves pickable
   so that "popup/move" works for them so that someone can instrument them with draggers in order to move them close to
   something to measure. It can easily be tested for example with "examples/polyhedron" from the main menu.
 - release note Cocoa : Read HepRep SLAC file format version 1 and 2. We can display geometries found in these files both
   in wire-frame and solid. (If wanting solid, you have to set Params/solid first). See file/Resources *.heprep for examples.
