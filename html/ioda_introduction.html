<div class="textblock"><p>ioda should be read "IO-DA", for Input/Output and for Data Analysis. It is a scientific application that permits to read files at various formats as FITS used in astronomy, ROOT and AIDA used in high energy physics (HEP), HDF5 with the g4tools data schema semantic, JPG format to store images and FOG developed at CEA/Saclay (France) to describe the LHC/ATLAS geometry. ioda permits to browse these files and visualize some of their data. </p>
<p>For AIDA files, the histograms 1D, 2D, profiles 1D, 2D can be plotted. For ROOT files, ioda can plot TH[1,2][D,F] objects along than TProfile ones. For g4tools/HDF5, ioda can plot 1D and 2D histograms. For JPG files, the image is visualized. For FITS astronomy files, the "HDUs" can be listed and their keys can be seen. If the HDU is an IMAGE_HDU type, ioda attempts to visualize it as an image (which is one of the primary goal of the FITS format : store astronomical pictures). If the HDU is a BINARY_TBL, ioda shows a description of the columns (name, type) and proposes to histogram and plot a selected column. Files at the FOG CEA/Saclay format permit to visualize LHC/ATLAS sub detectors. </p>
<p>Since 1.14.x, ioda contains the gopaw core and can execute .kumac files. </p>
<p>There are demos on YouTube. Search for "Guy Barrand channel". </p>
