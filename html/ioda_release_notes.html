1.2</h1>
<p>ntuple projection : for ntuple (defined as a table of columns with numbers), ioda can now do interactive projections of one or two columns in a 1D or 2D histogram. This works for a "flat TTree" in a ROOT file, a BINARY_TABLE in a FITS file, a flat ntuple in an AIDA file and table data in a CSV file.</p>
<p>new file types : CSV, hippodraw TNT (CSV+a header with a first line for a global title and a second line with labels of columns).</p>
<p>examples : have a demo.root file to play with ntuple.</p>
<p>plot style : once having a plot, this sub menu permits to change the overall style according to a set of predefined ones.</p>
<p>FTP : we have implemented "FTP passive".</p>

1.1</h1>
<p>iOS : we have implemented the Apple document interchange for file types known by ioda. Now applications as Dropbox, GoodReader, Mail can "Open in..." a file toward ioda.</p>
<p>Android : we have implemented an "intent-filter" so that when choosing a file in applications as Dropbox or "Linda Manager", ioda is proposed as a candidate viewer to open the file.</p>
<p>We have added a FTP button in the main menu to be able to get data files with FTP. See <a class="el" href="ioda_files.html#ioda_files_ftp">The FTP button</a>. With this button and the upper interchange feature you can get data files without the need to connect your device to a desktop.</p>
<p>A "params" button had been added to specify some visualization parameters. For example you can now render a FOG file in solid with or without lightening. The "lighten cube" example had been added to play with this feature. See <a class="el" href="ioda_gallery.html">Gallery</a> for some pictures.</p>
<p>The bottom left area in the camera panel is now a button that permits to toggle the arrows to a "90 degrees" mode. When set, the left/right (up/down) arrows rotates the camera by 90 degrees around the y (x) axis.</p>
<p>When browsing a CERN/ROOT file, directories are no more prefixed with "d:" but are shown with a different color (by default in light grey whilst files are still rendered in white).</p>
<p>In the "entries" example, the labels had been changed to : text, uint, int, real. It helpes understand the comportement of the entry keyboard for each kind of item.</p>
<p>For desktop version : we have added the -iPhone4 option to have same window size layout as an iPhone4.</p>
